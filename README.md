# 31/07/2022 - Update
**This project is no longer officially supported by the original developers.** You can find the old information for it in the INFO.md file, but I and others have given up on this project as a whole after terrible decisions with projects made with this (SC++), poor management, poor coding practices (the source code is built ontop of a sinking ship, honestly), and it being too much of an undertaking that's not worth it ultimately. This repository will remain here, and anyone may fork it to continue working on it if they so please. The treatment I received from the SMW community and how shitty SMWCentral is, and it's moderation team, including the fact that SMW's community has become a literal snowflake hugbox that doesn't understand satire, that support the wrong side of history, and with no chance of improving at all, all of this has driven me away from continuing work on this. It was a fun ride, but we are retiring from working on this.

# JFKMW Public Release Repository
![build](https://github.com/AVeryPainedRaspcallion/RaspcallionJFKMW/actions/workflows/build-all.yml/badge.svg) See actions https://github.com/AVeryPainedRaspcallion/RaspcallionJFKMW/actions

This is the new JFKMW Repository with the latest major version (>= 4.0.0), a mario fan-game/engine dedicated to trying to replicate the original Super Mario World as much as possible while introducing new features for limitless modding potential, and a multiplayer client/server system for playing custom content made with the game.

The code hosted here contains no copyrighted assets or any stolen code. Most things have been reverse engineered and recoded completely from the original game, while also trying to keep compatibility with custom resources made for the original game.

This code is all licensed under AGPLv3, commercial usage heavily discouraged (see License), after all it's a homage to one of our favorite games and meant as a free platform for expression and creativity.
